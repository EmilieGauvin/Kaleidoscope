# Kaleidoscope gradient

Inspired by the physics of kaleidoscopes, this gradient is slowly evolving. Toggle the kaleidoscope by clicking and dragging and watch the colored shapes metamorphose. 
As the blurred 3D body slowly revolves around itself or is spun by the user, it is infinitely reflected in a three-faced mirror tunnel merged with the camera.
